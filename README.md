#Use Swift in a Docker container!

Sparkly features include:
- Swift on Windows!
- write and test your Swift code in a container or virtual machine!
- deploy your app to the ☁️ in a flash!

#Getting Started
You need to install Docker ([Mac](https://docs.docker.com/mac/started/), [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/linux/started/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/started/)).

When you're done with the installation, you can type the following to download the image:

`docker pull swizzlr/swift`

And then you can compile and run a little "hello world" app inside the container:

`docker run swizzlr/swift swift main.swift`

To see an example of running your own code inside a docker container, check out [swift-docker-example](https://github.com/swizzlr/swift-docker-example).

REPL support coming very soon!
